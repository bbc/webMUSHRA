      intro: <p align=left>Please read the experiment instructions below and ask any questions you have to the experimenter on Slack or via Email. Please also read the notices about personal data and privacy and how we will use your responses. If you are happy to continue, please fill in the declaration form and click ‘I Agree’ before starting the experiment.</p>
      instructions: <p align=left>Please ensure that you are in a quiet environment and that you have your AirPods Pro with the spatial audio feature enabled as well as your iOS device with the installed experimental app.</p><p align=left>In this experiment you will listen to various excerpts of several content types with the Apple AirPods while using the experimental application installed on your iOS device. For each excerpt you will be asked to rate your overall listening experience on a simple scale. In particular, you will be asked “How much do you enjoy listening to the following music item(s)” with possible answers ranging from “not at all” to “very much”. When making your ratings you should take everything into account that you would normally in a real world scenario (e.g. your taste in music, the audio quality etc.). The experiment involves two sections; in section 1 you will be asked to rate the overall listening experience of several excerpts on a single page. In section 2 you will be asked to rate the listening experience of the same excerpts again and also select all the characteristics of the listening experience that contributed to your rating. After you have selected the relevant characteristics, you will also have the ability to provide additional notes, which could include further explanation for your rating or any other characteristics that contributed to it. Each section will start with specific instructions for the tasks in that section and a chance to familiarise yourself with the interface and required response.</p><p align=left>In section 1, you will evaluate 5 excerpts, whereas in section 2 you will evaluate 10 excerpts. Before the evaluation task, you will have the chance to familiarize yourself with the task and the interface. Once familiar with the latter, you will be asked to evaluate each several excerpts as explained earlier.</p><p align=left>During each evaluation task, please listen carefully to the suggested clips on your iOS device. These will be labelled ‘Stimuli 1’, 'Stimuli 2’, 'Stimuli 3', etc.. Please listen to the clips in turn and ensure you are rating the correct stimuli by looking at the stimuli number on this interface. You may listen to the excerpt as many times as you wish but please make sure to listen to the entire clip at least once.</p><p align=left>Once you have completed the evaluation task, you may click ’Next’ to move on to the next evaluation task. A progress bar at the top of the page will indicate your progress through the experiment.</p><p align=left>Please note that you can take a break at any time during the experiment. We estimate that the entire experiment will take about 20 (to check!) minutes, though this will vary between individual participants.</p><p align=left>Once the evaluation tasks of both sections are complete, there will be a short questionnaire to collect some information about yourself, which will aid our analysis. Once you have filled this in and clicked ‘Send Results’, the experiment session is complete and you can close the browser window. Until this point, we do not store your responses, so if the browser window is closed before this point, we will not receive any data from you and your responses will be lost. Please keep your browser window open until you have completed the experiment.</p>
