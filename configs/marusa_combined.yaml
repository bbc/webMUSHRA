      content: <p><b>Welcome to this listening experiment! Thank you for taking part.</b></p><p align="left">We are evaluating the listening experience of the Apple AirPods Spatial Audio feature. More specifically, we are investigating both the overall listening experience as well as its specific characteristics.</p><p align="left">Please read the experimental instructions on the following page and ask any questions you have to the experimenter. Please also read the notices on page 3 about personal data and privacy and how we will use your responses.</p>

      content: <p align=left>Please ensure that you are in a quiet environment and that you have your AirPods Pro with the spatial audio feature enabled as well as your iOS device with the installed experimental app.</p><p align=left>In this experiment you will listen to various excerpts with your AirPods Pro while using the experimental application on your iOS device. For each excerpt you will be asked to <b>rate your overall listening experience</b> on a simple scale using this web-based interface. In particular, you will be asked <i>“How much do you enjoy listening to the following excerpt(s)”</i> with possible answers ranging from <i>“Not at all”</i> to <i>“Very much”</i>. When making your ratings you should take everything into account that you would normally in a real world scenario (e.g. your taste in music, the audio quality etc.).</p><p align=left>The experiment has two identical parts and each part has two sections. In section 1, you will be asked to rate the overall listening experience of 5 excerpts on a single page. In section 2, you will be asked to rate the listening experience of 10 excerpts and <b>select all the attributes or characteristics</b> of the listening experience that contributed to your rating. After you have selected the relevant attributes, you will also have the ability to <b>provide additional notes</b>, which could include further explanation for your rating or any other attributes that contributed to it. Once you have completed a section, you may click "Next" to move on to the next section. A progress bar at the top of the page will indicate your progress through the experiment.</p><p align=left>Before the actual experiment, you will have the chance to familiarize yourself with the task and the interface. Please adjust the volume on your iOS device to a desired level during the familiarization phase and try to keep it the same throughout the subsequent experiment. After completing the familiarization phase for both section 1 and 2, you will move onto part 1 of the experiment. After completing both sections of part 1, please take a break of at least 30 minutes before moving onto part 2.</p><p align=left>Before the rating task, please listen carefully to the excerpts on your iOS device. These will be labelled "Stimulus 1", "Stimulus 2", "Stimulus 3"... Please ensure that you are rating the correct stimulus by checking that the stimulus name on your iOS device matches the stimulus name on this interface. You may listen to the excerpts as many times as you wish but please make sure to listen to each excerpt from start to finish at least once.</p><p align=left>You may take a break at any time during the experiment. We estimate that the entire experiment will take about 30 (to check!) minutes, though this will vary between individual participants.</p><p align=left>Once you have completed both parts of the experiment, you will be asked to fill out a short questionnaire to collect some information about yourself, which will aid our analysis. Once you have filled this in and clicked "Send Results", the experiment is complete and you can close the browser window. Until this point, we do not store your responses, so if the browser window is closed before this point, we will not receive any data from you and your responses will be lost. Please keep your browser window open until you have completed the experiment.</p>
